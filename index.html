        <h1>😀 Grinning Face</h1>
        <p>
          A yellow face with simple, open eyes and a broad, open smile, showing
          upper teeth and tongue on some platforms. Often conveys general
          pleasure and good cheer or humor. Not to be confused with 😃 Grinning
          Face With Big Eyes or 😄 Grinning Face With Smiling Eyes, which have
          the same smiles but more expressive eye shapes. This emoji has a cat
          variant, 😺 Grinning Cat Face.
        </p>

        <h1>🤣 Rolling on the Floor Laughing</h1>
        <p>
          A yellow face with a big grin and scrunched, X-shaped eyes, tilted on
          its side as if rolling on the floor laughing (the internet acronym
          ROFL). Sheds two tears and tilts right on most platforms. Often
          conveys hysterical laughter more intense than 😂 Face With Tears of
          Joy. Microsoft's design previously featured a smiley with hands and
          feet.

        <h1>😊 Smiling Face</h1>
        <p>
          A classic smiley. A yellow face with a modest smile, rosy cheeks, and
          soft, closed eyes. Many platforms, including Apple, feature relaxed
          eyebrows. Conveys a wide range of warm, positive feelings, including
          love, happiness, and gratitude. Similar to 😊 Smiling Face With
          Smiling Eyes, which has a broader smile, no eyebrows, and smiling
          eyes.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h1>😉 Winking Face</h1>
        <p>
          A yellow face with a slight smile shown winking, usually its left eye.
          May signal a joke, flirtation, hidden meaning, or general positivity.
          Tone varies, including playful, affectionate, suggestive, or ironic.
          Not to be confused with the more mischievous or sexual 😏 Smirking
          Face. An emoji form of the ;) emoticon.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>😋 Face Savoring Food</h1>
        <p>
          A yellow face with smiling eyes and a broad, closed smile with its
          tongue sticking out of one corner, as if licking its lips in appetite
          or contentment. Widely used to convey that a food item is delicious.
          May also express that a person is attractive.
